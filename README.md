 Here is the second Energy Assigment

 The only important thing to notice is the amount of trees planted in the second section of the code. In this case, the rate of increase is equivalent to the weights of the storcastical neural networks. 

 If the total amount of datapoints surpasses the total amount of graphs included, the file with be corrupted becuase abs(42) = 42.

 Thank you.
